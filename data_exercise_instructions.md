# Data Exercise Instructions

Congratulations on advancing to the data exercise round!  The goal of this exercise is for you to demonstrate your *analytical thinking, communication, and technical skills*.  It also helps expose you to the type of work we do every day here at Mathematica (MPR).  

## Background

Data scientists and statisticians at MPR often write up their initial findings to help inform the larger project team of key insights.  Attached is a dataset (HOSPITAL_SAFETY.xlsx) that represents what our team works with on a daily basis. The dataset contains information about two sets of hospitals, one that participated in a policy intervention designed to improve patient safety (Treatment = TRUE), and one that did not.  The goal was to reduce central-line associated blood stream infections (CLABSIs), with lower rates being more desirable. The policy was implemented at the beginning of 2016. The pre-intervention results are in the SIR15 column, and the post-intervention results are in the SIR16 column. One tab in the Excel file has the data (HOSPITAL_SAFETY), and the other has information on the data (Data dictionary).

## Tasks

We would like you to complete the following tasks:

* Complete an initial analysis of the data to estimate the effect of the intervention on CLABSI rates. (This could include EDA and modeling.)
* Communicate your findings to your larger MPR team via a high-level, not-highly-technical email to your colleagues informing them of the results.
* Include the code you used to run your analysis.

We expect this initial exploration to take no more than three hours.  *Please do not spend more time than that!*  We are more interested in how you (1) approach the problem and (2) communicate further avenues for investigation than a completely polished, final analysis.

## Guidelines

* Assume your team can use the following types of files: R, R markdown, Python, Jupyter notebook, Microsoft Office Suite, PDF.
* You may use any libraries available for R or Python to complete your analysis.
* Prioritize including one or two visualizations or tables that help drive home your findings over lots of prose.
* You may include a list of analytic next steps as part of the email to your team.

Please submit your response (email, visualizations/tables, and code) to Ruth Vélez (rvelez@mathematica-mpr.com) and Eva Ward (eward@mathematica-mpr.com).  If you have any questions, please contact Eva Ward (eward@mathematica-mpr.com) for clarification.  

We’re excited to see what you find!
